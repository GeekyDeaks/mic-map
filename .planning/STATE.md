# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-22)

**Core value:** Covering the microphone reliably toggles the SteamVR dashboard, invisibly to the rest of VR — no controller beam, no extra hardware, no focus loss.
**Current focus:** Milestone concluded — released as v1.5 (previous pre-GSD release was v1.0.0). Phase 05 (Documentation) deferred.

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (installer) — CLOSED (UAT 10/10 pass after double-VR_Init fix commit 3187fbb + UAT closeout commit 53f0da7)
Plan: all 9 plans closed
Release: v1.5 tagged at 53f0da7; installer artifact build/installer/MicMap-Setup-v0.1.0.exe (SHA256 f2a62d662b833264e588ddb1544a8af3461597ca0c2c766f65dab55917451651) published as GitHub release.
Deferred: Phase 05 (Documentation) carried forward to next milestone (README + architecture docs to match shipped reality).
Last activity: 2026-04-24 -- Milestone v1.0 released as v1.5

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 3 plans)

**Phase 3 closure (2026-04-23):** Live UAT on Bigscreen Beyond + Win11 rig passed all 5 procedures (A/B/C/D/E). AUTO-01 / AUTO-04 / AUTO-05 closed at live-UAT level; AUTO-02 / AUTO-03 / AUTO-06 upgraded from integration-level (Plan 06) to live-UAT. Two non-blocking UAT deviations recorded in `03-07-UAT.md`: (1) A1 rc=0 offline — VRApplication_Utility is offline-capable; plan assumption rc=1 was wrong; actual behavior is more robust and unblocks Phase 4 installer [Run] step; (2) Procedure C log-file path doesn't exist — logger is stdout-only; teardown evidence gathered via Task Manager + Plan 05 unit tests; follow-up: wire %APPDATA%\\MicMap\\micmap.log file sink in Phase 5 or a dedicated observability micro-plan.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Rip out virtual-controller driver entirely — no fallback, no feature flag (SVR-04).
- Adopt sidecar-on-HMD technique validated in bey-closer-t1 (`HMD Button Stub.md`).
- Use SteamVR-native auto-start (`app.vrmanifest`) — no Windows Run-key / Startup folder.
- Inno Setup installer patterned on `BeyondProximity.iss`, but MicMap owns its own driver directory (not nested).
- Fix stubbed JSON config read-back with already-vendored nlohmann/json.
- Phase 2 (Config Read-Back) is parallel-safe with Phase 1 (Driver Sidecar).
- Sidecar Init: HTTP start is fail-closed (VRInitError_Driver_Failed); HMD component creation is deferred to RunFrame to satisfy SVR-02
- HttpServer /status endpoint retained (not deleted) because app-side DriverClient::getStatus() probes /status rather than /health
- T-03-02 (browser Origin-check) deferred to a future driver-observability phase; default bind is loopback-only so in-scope browser CSRF is low-risk
- Plan 01-04 stripped DashboardState/HMDButtonAction enums and the four IVRInput dashboard methods (getDashboardState/sendHMDButtonEvent/sendDashboardSelect/performDashboardAction) per Plan 01-02 SUMMARY hand-off and 01-04 Task 3 Part D; VREventType enum kept (apps consume Quit + SteamVRConnected/Disconnected)
- hmd_button_test.exe harness now exposes Send Press / Send Release / Tap (press+150ms+release) buttons that drive IDriverClient::press()/release() directly; Open Dashboard/Send Click/Auto/Send A/Send System buttons and handlers removed (SVR-07 gate: zero forbidden-string hits across driver/src src/ apps/)
- Plan 03-01 publishes parseCliArgs's CliFlags struct at src/common/include/micmap/common/cli_flags.hpp (D-01 left location to discretion; chose micmap::common to avoid leaking apps/micmap private code into tests)
- Plan 03-01 vrmanifest schema test uses ${CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}/$<CONFIG>/app.vrmanifest path (multi-config-correct under MSBuild) and links against bare `nlohmann_json` target (project's external/CMakeLists.txt declares interface lib without `::` alias)
- Plan 03-01 vr_input quit-ordering test follows OPTION 1 (free function processVREvent in vr_input_events.{hpp,cpp}) — Plan 03-05 must extract to free fn rather than refactor OpenVRInput class internals
- Plan 03-02 — A2 LOCKED to STRING form: 'arguments': '--minimized'. SteamVR auto-launched 'micmap.exe --minimized' on Bigscreen Beyond + Win11; array-form variant deleted; test_vrmanifest_schema strict-asserts string form. Forward-slash manifest path is a SILENT KILLER (vrserver treats it as working dir, skips manifest, returns no error) — surfaced as <critical_pitfall> in Plan 03-04 with mandatory runtime guard.
- Plan 03-03 closes Q4 GREEN: Phase 2 writer requires explicit per-field wiring (j["key"] = c.field) — no struct introspection in nlohmann::json. Future AppConfig fields require 3 edits: declaration, read line, write line.
- Plan 03-04 — IVRApplicationsSurface seam uses vr::EVRApplicationError return types (plan proposed uint32_t; test contract from Plan 03-01 required native enum). GetApplicationsErrorNameFromEnum non-pure (has default impl) so the test stub that overrides only 4 methods can be instantiated. OpenVR linkage on micmap_steamvr elevated from PRIVATE to PUBLIC; Pathcch linked PRIVATE on WIN32.
- Plan 03-05 — free function named processVREventImpl (not processVREvent) to keep OpenVRInput::processVREvent member's delegation call-site unambiguous; Plan 01 RED test renamed in same commit (62fe4a5)
- Plan 03-05 — OpenVRInput uses nested private adapter classes (VRSystemAdapter + EventSinkAdapter) to bridge production vr::IVRSystem + member notifyEvent to the OpenVR-free seam in vr_input_events.hpp; AUTO-05 / D-11 ack-before-notify invariant locked at unit level
- Plan 03-06 — namespace aligned to Plan 01 RED test (micmap::apps plural, not micmap::app singular as plan prose suggested). Plan 01's working tree had an uncommitted src/common/src/cli_flags.cpp; committed under 03-06 Task 1 tag so per-task commit chain stays clean. Grep-gate-aware comments: forbidden tokens (AllocConsole, strstr(lpCmdLine) paraphrased so regex gates stay clean.
- Plan 03-07 — UAT deviation 1: Procedure A1 plan assumption rc=1 / VRInitError_Init_HmdNotFound was WRONG. VR_Init with VRApplication_Utility mode works offline — utility APIs talk directly to vrpathreg + %LOCALAPPDATA%\\openvr\\openvrpaths.vrpath + appconfig.json on disk, no running vrserver required. Actual rc=0 offline is more robust and is exactly what the Phase 4 installer [Run] post-install step needs. No code change required; plan text to be cleaned up on next touch (cosmetic).
- Plan 03-07 — UAT deviation 2 (plan gap, observability): Procedure C assumed a file log at %APPDATA%\\MicMap\\micmap.log that does not exist. MicMap's logger is stdout-only via ConsoleLogger; WINDOWS subsystem discards stdout. Ordered-teardown evidence gathered instead from Task Manager (under-watchdog exit, no zombie, no "killed" dialog) + Plan 03-05 unit tests (ack-first invariant). Non-blocking for AUTO-05 closure. Follow-up: wire a FileLogger tee'd alongside ConsoleLogger in a dedicated observability micro-plan or folded into Phase 5 DOC-02.
- Plan 03-07 — 5-cycle OpenVR #1547 drift characterization on Bigscreen Beyond: 0 drift observed. Informational, NOT proof that #1547 is extinct — retry-thread self-heal remains as defense-in-depth. If field reports surface drift post-ship, escalate to v1.x "Re-register" UI button (original Phase 3 research spike disposition).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Research-flagged validation spikes (budget by phase planners):

- **Phase 1:** HMD reactivation lifecycle (Case D) untested in bey-closer-t1 — validation spike required before phase exit.
- **Phase 3:** `SetApplicationAutoLaunch` persistence bug (OpenVR issue #1547) — multiple-restart UAT cycles needed.
- **Phase 4:** Upgrade-from-0.x ghost-binding cleanup (Pitfall 8) — requires real test machine with legacy driver installed. Inno Setup 6 Pascal Script gotchas (Pitfall 16) warrant half-day buffer.
